# Decision-Support-System-for-Article-Ranking
This project provides a Decision Support System for ranking of scientific papers.

<h2>E-R Model</h2>

First part of the DSS consists of an Entityâ€“relationship model that describes the information aspect of the database.
The database can then be directly constructed from the E-R model alone with no precondition of developing it further.

<h5>Remark:</h5> The E-R model is an adaptation of a theoretical model presented in the article <a href="https://www.thinkmind.org/index.php?view=article&articleid=advcomp_2014_4_20_20073">
<i>"Towards a Decision Support System for Automated Selection of Optimal Neural Network Instance for Research and Engineering"</i></a>.
Therefore, the current model is directed at ranking articles regarding Neural Networks and some revisions may be required in order to use it for another purpose.
